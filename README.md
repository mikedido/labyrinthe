### Move the robot

To play just use the keyboard :
    
    Q which must allow to save and leave the game in progress;
    N which asks the robot to move to the north (ie the top of your screen);
    E that asks the robot to move east (that is, the right of your screen);
    S which asks the robot to move to the south (that is, the bottom of your screen);
    O who asks the robot to move to the west (that is, the left of your screen);

Each of the directions above followed by a number allows to advance several boxes (for example E3 to advance three boxes to the east).
